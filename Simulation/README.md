To run this simulation first the libraries should be installed. 

With anaconda,I have created a separted environment called car with all the dependencies.

After the libraries are install user should genrate training data by driving in the simulator. 

To run the simulator,simply user have to execute the DefaultWindowsdesktop64-bit.exe file

After generating train data the user should  run the model.py for training.

By writing pyhon model.py the user should be able to train the data. It would take around 15-20 minutes.

Fnally When the training is done the user can run the simulation using python drive.py model.h5(model.h5 is our trained model)
