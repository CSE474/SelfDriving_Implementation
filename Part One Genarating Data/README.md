To generate our training data, we had to run our simulator. 

Unity has a built-in mode to generate training data which is called Training Mode. 

Through Training Mode we had to first start recording and later drive the car around the track. 

After hitting the record unity takes three photos from its three cameras, its steering angle and 

its speed and stores it in a CSV which is named driving_log.csv.
